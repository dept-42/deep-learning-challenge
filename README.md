# deep-learning-challenge
Directory contains files and notebooks related to analysis of funding and outcomes of
Alphabet Soup Charity:
-  two jupyter notebooksL
   1. 'deep_learning_challenge.ipynb' This is the initial neural network analysis, 
       resulting in model 'AphabetSoupCharity.h5'
   2. 'AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb'. A second model that attempt to optimize
      the neural netwok, resulting in a second model, AlphabetSoupCharity_optimnized.keras
- keras-scanner output from the development wprkflow for the second model (found in the
      'tune_dir' subdirectory)
